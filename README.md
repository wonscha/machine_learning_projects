# Machine Learning Projects

The purpose of this repository is not only to personally practice implemention of general machine learning algorithms but also to deeply understand how it works while implementing it. Thus, codes written in team structure or for commercial purpose will not be stored in this repository. 

In many cases, tasks have come from assignments of college or kaggle.


# Structure

Deep Learning: Neural Network model implementations 
Supervied Learning: Machine Learning models trained by supervised learning technique. Deep Learning models are excluded.
Unsupervised Learning: Machine Learning models trained by unsupervised learning technique.
