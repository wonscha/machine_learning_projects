# Machine Learning Projects

The purpose of this repository is not only to personally practice implemention of general machine learning algorithms but also to deeply understand how it works while implementing it. Thus, codes written in team structure or for commercial purpose will not be stored in this repository. 

In many cases, tasks have come from assignments of college or textbooks.


## Structure of Repository

This repository is structured according to the goal of task.</br>

- Foundation: Associated only to the foundation of machine learning not to specific downstream tasks</br>
- Computer Vision: Implementations of image related task such as image classification</br>
- Natural Language Processing: Implementations of language processing task</br>
- Unsupervised Learning: Implementations of unsupervised learning technique
