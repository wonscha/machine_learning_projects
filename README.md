# Machine Learning Projects

The purpose of this repository is to implement machine learning algorithms and deeply understand how it works. 

# Structure
Supervised Learning
In supervised learning we have a set of training data as an input and a set of labels or "correct answers" for each training set as an output. Then we're training our model (machine learning algorithm parameters) to map the input to the output correctly (to do correct prediction). The ultimate purpose is to find such model parameters that will successfully continue correct inputâ†’output mapping (predictions) even for new input examples.
